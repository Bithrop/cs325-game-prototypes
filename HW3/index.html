<h2>Don't leave without your eggs</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
As far as I know, besides the collecting part, not a whole like this game exepct maybe sorta like snake.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The fact tat you get faster and you lose when you go out of bounds.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Learned how to use basic x an y values for the things I needed
Easiest thing was the movment while the hardest was getting the eggs to reset everytime you picked them up.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Using these three examples plus the given game template.
1)https://phaser.io/examples/v2/p2-physics/kill-and-revive
2)https://phaser.io/examples/v2/sprites/out-of-bounds
3)https://phaser.io/examples/v2/input/keyboard
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Go around gathering eggs without leaving the screen while also getting faster as you go.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Chicken.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard, plenty as the egg spots are random, adventrue, and collector/achiever
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
1) How fast you can go and 2) testing the effectiveness of going out of bounds.
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The feeling of getting faster and faster until they can't take the speed anymore.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The actions the player can preform are to use the arrow keys to move the chicken around. However, when you press an arrow you keep moving in that direction until
you press another arrow. You're trying to gather the eggs to get points but each egg you pick up makes you go faster. If you go off the edge, the game ends.

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Not really strategies as it focuses more of relaxes although one strategy is to stay close to the center as to 
not speed out.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You're a chicken who's decied to leave his nest. Before you leave you ealize that you left a bunch of your eggs lying around.
You think it's best if you gather them up before you leave. You keep getting more excited though with every egg you pick up.
You can't help but feel with how fast you're going you'll leave the nest before you gather them all.
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who knows how to push the arrow keys.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About thirty seconds to a minute.
