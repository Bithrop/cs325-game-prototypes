In between rounds you will have options to build defenses and upgrades to help fend off these birds. Depending on how many crops you still have left in between each round will determine how many defenses and/or upgrades you get.

You’re a farmer on their last legs. Each season has been tough for you but with these special crops that you found at the store you should be able to make a profit each day. However, these crops also attract flocks upon flocks of birds to eat them. You’ll be out in the field each day making sure to keep your crops safe as the crops determine if you have food on the plate each morning.
